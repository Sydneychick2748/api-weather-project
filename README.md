<!-- AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city -->

<!-- hint____Using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you'll notice that you will need to pass in coordinates instead of just a city name. Using the OpenWeatherMap APIs, how could we retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name? -->


 #Description
 
 This weather app allows you to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that you can plan a trip accordingly. 
You can input any city in the world and then see the current weather for that city and the five-day forecast for that specific city. Then, when you want to go back and check that particular city again, it will be stored in your history, and you can just click on the city you searched for before, and the weather will show again; you can also look for new city  if you choose to. You can view the live site here. 
This project was great to do. Learning the API calls, getting the key, and looking in the JSON for the data was fun. I loved using template literals to display the data on the page. The tricky part for me was showing the history and having the history being able to be clickable, and re-displaying the weather. I love doing this assignment and playing with the weather API.

#Installation

To set up the development environment and run it, I made a folder in my finder and named it. Then I went to GitHub and created a new repository using the same name I called my folder. Then I dropped the file in vs. and made my coding environment. First, I set up my HTML file: index. html, I set up the CSS file: styles.css and my JavaScript file: script.js. Then went back to GitHub, copied the ssh key, and made a clone. Then pushed my code to GitHub.

#Usage
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule Here is a video to show the functionality of the planner

WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

image

WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event

image

WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

image

WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist

image

when i click the clear button all the inputs that were saved are no longer saved
